# Employee-Salary-Prediction-Using-ML-Algorithms

This project predicts employee salaries using various machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset containing employee information.

## üìú Description

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the salary of an employee based on several features such as their years of experience, education level, and job role. This can be a valuable tool for Human Resources departments to ensure fair and competitive compensation.

This project covers the entire machine learning workflow:

  * **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
  * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (salary).
  * **Model Training**: Training several regression models to find the best performing one.
  * **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics like Accuracy Score , F1 Score , Precision etc...

## üíæ Dataset

The dataset used for this project should contain information about employees. A typical dataset for this kind of project would include the following features:

  * **Age**: Age of the employee.
  * **Gender**: Gender of the employee.
  * **Education Level**: The highest level of education attained by the employee.
  * **Job Title**: The employee's job title.
  * **Years of Experience**: The number of years of professional experience the employee has.
  * **Salary**: The employee's salary (this is the target variable).

"The dataset used in this project is the 'Salary Data' from Kaggle."

## ü§ñ Models Used

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this project. The following models are commonly used for regression tasks like salary prediction:

  * **Logistiic Regression**
  * **Random Forest**
  * **Gradient Boosting**
  * **XGBoost**
  * **LightGBMr**

"The LightGBM was chosen as the final model due to its high accuracy and robustness."
